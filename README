WHAT IS PandaSync?
--------------

PandaSync is a fast and extraordinarily versatile file copying tool for
both remote and local files.

PandaSync uses a delta-transfer algorithm which provides a very fast method
for bringing remote files into sync.  It does this by sending just the
differences in the files across the link, without requiring that both
sets of files are present at one of the ends of the link beforehand.  At
first glance this may seem impossible because the calculation of diffs
between two files normally requires local access to both files.

SETUP
-----

Pandasync normally uses ssh or rsh for communication with remote systems.
It does not need to be setuid and requires no special privileges for
installation.  You must, however, have a working ssh or rsh system.
Using ssh is recommended for its security features.

Alternatively, pandasync can run in `daemon' mode, listening on a socket.
This is generally used for public file distribution, although
authentication and access control are available.

To install Pandasync, first run the "configure" script.  This will create a
Makefile and config.h appropriate for your system.  Then type "make".

Note that on some systems you will have to force configure not to use
gcc because gcc may not support some features (such as 64 bit file
offsets) that your system may support.  Set the environment variable CC
to the name of your native compiler before running configure in this
case.

Once built put a copy of pandasync in your search path on the local and
remote systems (or use "make install").  That's it!
