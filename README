WHAT IS PandaSync?
--------------
    
    It's a hybrid cloud sync scheme, PandaSync, that combines full sync and delta sync dynamically based on file size and network conditions.
    To further improve small-file sync performance, we propose an optimization, Full2Sync, that merges the connection establishment request with the file-sending
request to reduce the number of network round-trips between the client and the cloud servers.
    PandaSync can be turned off and switched to either Full Sync scheme or Delta Sync scheme to provide much better flexibility.
    PandaSync has three main functional modules: File Size Monitor, Network-aware Dynamic Threshold and Sync Method Selector. 
    The Network-aware Dynamic Threshold module is responsible for determining the size threshold between large files and small files based on the network performance which is detailed in the next subsection. Upon the initiation of a sync operation, the File Size Monitor first fetches the information regarding the size of the file and calculates the checksum values. This information is sent and gathered in the Sync Method Selector module which chooses an appreciate sync method between full sync and delta sync.
